# Improving the learning performance of a memristor neural network using optimisation techniques
This repository includes the code that was used in the Bachelor thesis of Luuk van Keeken, which can be found at https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/24934/1/bAI_2021_LuukvanKeeken.pdf. A large part of the code was originally created by Tiotto et al. (2021), for their paper that can be accessed here: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.627276/full. The corresponding Github repository can be accessed at https://github.com/Tioz90/Learning-to-approximate-functions-using-niobium-doped-strontium-titanate-memristors.
